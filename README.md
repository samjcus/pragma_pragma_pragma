# pragma_pragma_pragma
Examples of parallel code in multiple languages.
These examples are common in parallel programming tutorials and can be solved in a number of ways.
Each example problem here has been solved using either a shared memory model (OpenMP/multithreading) or message passing model (MPI/mpi4py) with C/fortran/python.

## Code styling
- C: lower case vars, explicit {}
- fortran: free form, lower case vars, upper case intrinsics
- python: PEP8, duh
